## Introduction:
* Brief overview of the project.
* Introduction to the dataset (source, size, variables).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Summary statistics: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc. for numerical variables like age, blood pressure, etc.
* Distribution of data: Histograms, box plots, etc.
* Missing values: Identify and handle missing values if any.
* Outlier detection: Identify outliers and decide how to handle them.
* Correlation analysis: Explore relationships between variables, especially with respect to the target variable (heart attacks).

## Data Visualization:
* Age distribution: Visualize the age distribution of patients.
* Gender distribution: Visualize the gender distribution of patients.
* Chest pain type: Visualize the distribution of chest pain types.
* Blood pressure distribution: Visualize the distribution of blood pressure.
* Other relevant visualizations based on the dataset.

## Feature Engineering:
* Create new features if necessary (e.g., age groups, BMI from height and weight).
* Encode categorical variables if necessary (e.g., gender, chest pain type).

## Machine Learning:
* Define the problem: Classification (predicting whether a person is likely to have a heart attack) or regression (predicting the risk or severity of a heart attack).
* Split data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Model selection: Choose appropriate machine learning models for the task (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.).
* Model training: Train the selected models on the training data.
* Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, etc.).
* Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tune hyperparameters of the models to improve performance.
* Final model selection: Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Dashboard Creation:
* Use tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries like Dash to create interactive dashboards.
* Include visualizations of key insights from EDA and machine learning results.
* Allow users to interact with the data and explore different aspects.

    Conclusion:
        Summarize key findings from the EDA and machine learning analysis.
        Discuss the implications of the findings for predicting and preventing heart attacks.
        Suggestions for further research or improvements to the project.
