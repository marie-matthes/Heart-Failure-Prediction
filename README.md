# Heart Failure Analysis & Prediction
Greenbootcamps Final Project

## About the Data Set

In today's fast-paced healthcare environment, health insurance companies need powerful tools to assess risk, make informed decisions, and engage with their customers. Our machine learning project provides an innovative solution that compares the performance of leading classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict whether a patient is likely to develop heart disease.

Join us as we leverage the power of machine learning to transform health insurance. Our project is not just about technologyâ€”it's about creating a healthier future for everyone.

We are working with the [Heart Failure Prediction Data Set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/data)
